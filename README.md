# Electricity

A short program to calculate how much to expect on your electric bill
In the UK it's commom for the meter to use two different readings with different rates each, and a fee per day of usage.

To run it with your providers rates, just check the back of your electicity bill and make the necessary changes in the code where it's marked so.

To run this program you need to install the pandas library first
> pip install pandas

It uses the ```datetime``` to calculate the days between inputs, the ```os``` to check and create a file, the ```csv``` to import the file to the program and ```pandas``` to do the analysis of the data.
